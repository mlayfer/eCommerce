# Product page for e-Commerce website

## Technology stack

In the project directory, you can run:

### `React 17`
### `create-react-app` as boilerplate
### `antd` for design components
### `styled-components` for styling
### `react-context` for state management

## Data

### `fakestoreapi.com`

## API issues
 - The data object didn't provide reviews for the product, therefore I've created a static "Reviews" object located in the Constants file
 - There was no seperated APIs for fullProductData and listOfProducts with thinner product information, therefore I've used the same API for both main and related items
